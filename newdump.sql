Lewis Perez was an artist of extraordinary talent who is best known for landscape paintings featuring three dimensional or raised trees, bushes and leaves. Perez, whose real name was Chester Lewis (1923-2010), worked also under the trade names \"Louis Perez,\" \"Lewis Perez\" and often simply \"Perez\" throughout the 1970\'s, 80\'s and 90\'s until his unofficial retirement from painting around year 2000.\n\nPerez began his career as an artist in the Old Town area of Chicago and later moved his studios and residence to suburban Northwest Indiana. Prior to becoming an artist, Perez was an Illinois registered pharmacist and his curiosity and knowledge of chemical compounds led him to develop a type of paint that resulted in a three-dimensional subject that is extremely durable, easy to clean, and simply unlike any other painting on the market of the time.

His date of birth is uncertain (around 1489). His father was a merchant. Otherwise, little is known about Correggio\'s life or training. In the years 1503-1505 he apprenticed to Francesco Bianchi Ferrara of Modena. Here he probably knew the classicism of artists like Lorenzo Costa and Francesco Francia, evidence of which can be found in his first works. After a trip to Mantua in 1506, he returned to Correggio, where he stayed until 1510. To this period is assigned the Adoration of the Child with St. Elizabeth and John, which shows clear influences from Costa and Mantegna. In 1514 he probably finished three tondos for the entrance of the church of Sant\'Andrea in Mantua, and then returned to Correggio: here, as an independent and increasingly renowned artist, he signed a contract for the Madonna altarpiece in the local monastery of St. Francis (now in the Dresden Gemaldegalerie).',60000000,1,11,'xl','portrait',NULL,'2017-08-24 14:37:19','2017-08-24 14:51:06'),(213,'a0213','F.
