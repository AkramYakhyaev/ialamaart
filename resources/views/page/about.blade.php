        <p class="about__text">Ialama Art Gallery & Shop family operated a business by Galina and Akram. We established with a clear goal of creating digital artworks and helping people to collect unique Midwest oil paintings. </p>
        <p class="about__text">How did it all start? Galina been drawing her entire life even after graduating CEO and Akram working as QA for a software company is collecting oil paintings through midwest for over 3 years. It took us long to find out that at heart we are artists, so we care about the quality of work we do.</p>
        <p class="about__text">What makes us stand out from the others is our commitment to customer care. We give the same personal attention to every customer and for every order. Each order is inspected by one of us. We always listen to our customerâ€™s needs beginning with pre-order questions to after order concerns. It is our goal to make sure that every customer goes away with a piece of art that they will enjoy for a lifetime. Throughout the process, our customers are kept up to date with the status of their order. We use the latest techniques and the best materials to ensure a top quality finished product.</p>
